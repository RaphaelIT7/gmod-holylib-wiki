<title>Wiki Structure</title>

# Structure
Currently, the wiki structure is a bit chaotic, but it's getting better.<br>

## Global category
This category contains **all** pages combined, allowing one to easily find them.

## Module categories
Each holylib module has its own category allowing one to easily view which functions belong to which module, but this has the downside, that the sidebar became quite large.<br>
Currently I don't have any better idea on how to improve this :/
