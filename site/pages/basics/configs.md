# Configs
Since the `0.8` release, HolyLib generates & loads some config files.<br>
These can be found in the `garrysmod/holylib/cfg/` folder.<br>

# Invalid Configs
If a config was invalid, it will print a warning and won't load it.<br>
This means that any values set in the config won't apply until you solve the issue<br>

# Module Configs
By default, any config values documented in this Wiki will be stored inside the `modules.json` file.<br>
