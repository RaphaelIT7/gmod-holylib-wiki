# Custom builds
With `0.8` HolyLib allows you can build your own custom versions.<br>
This allows you to remove certain modules or features so that you end up with a version fitted to your needs.<br>

You can fork the HolyLib repository (https://github.com/RaphaelIT7/gmod-holylib) and use the `Build Custom Version`.<br>
You will be given the option to include/remove modules or features, and it'll do the compiling for you.

<note>
	Custom builds currently are only available for Linux
