The holylib wiki.  
I like the gmod wiki, and since many probably got used to it, it's best to have a similar one.  

It's still missing many things, but were getting there.  
I expect this to potentially be taken down at some point since were literally using things of the original wiki like the js and css, but my hopes are garry won't mind it.  
(I suck at css & js so if this would happen I would just return to a simple readme like it was before :/)
